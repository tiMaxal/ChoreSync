# ChoreSynCal
**ChoreSynCal** [Chores Sync to Calendar] is a user-friendly Python application that transforms your household chore list into a calendar-compatible .ics file. Import your chores into Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or any iCalendar-supported app, with customizable reminders and repetition periods to keep your home organized effortlessly.


## Features
- CSV Input: Load chores from a CSV file (format: Room, Frequency, Task).
- Flexible Scheduling: Set a specific time of day for chore reminders.
- Repetition Periods: Choose between monthly or yearly chore cycles.
- Re-import Reminder: Schedule a reminder to regenerate your chore calendar before the period ends.
- Calendar Integration: Generates .ics files for seamless import into major calendar apps.

## Requirements
Python 3.6+
Libraries: tkinter, icalendar
A CSV file with columns: Room, Frequency (Daily, Weekly, Monthly), Task

## Installation
- Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- Install required libraries:
```
pip install icalendar
```
[Note: tkinter is typically included with Python. If not, install it (e.g., sudo apt-get install python3-tk on Debian-based systems).]
- Download the `ChoreSynCal.py` script.

## Usage
- Prepare a CSV file with your chores, formatted like: Frequency,Room,Task
Daily,Kitchen,Wipe down counters
Weekly,Bathroom,Scrub toilet
Monthly,Bedroom,Organize drawers

- Run the script:
```
python ChoreSynCal.py
```

- In the GUI:
    - Click "Browse" to select your CSV file.
    - Enter the time of day for chores (e.g., "09:00" for 9 AM).
    - Choose a repetition period (Month or Year).
    - Specify days before the period ends for a re-import reminder
         (e.g., "7" for a week before).
    - Click "Generate ICS File" and choose a save location.

- Import the generated .ics file into your calendar app
     (e.g., Google Calendar, Apple Calendar).

### Example
For a CSV with "Kitchen,Daily,Wipe down counters", selecting 9:00 AM and a monthly period will create daily events at 9:00 AM for wiping kitchen counters, with 15-minute reminders, until the end of the month. A re-import reminder will be added (e.g., 7 days before the month ends).

### Notes
- Ensure the CSV has the exact columns: Frequency, Room, Task.
- Frequency must be "Daily", "Weekly", or "Monthly" (case-insensitive).
- The time of day must be in 24-hour format (HH:MM).
- The re-import reminder days must be a positive integer.
