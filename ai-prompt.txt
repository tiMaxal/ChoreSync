 - prompt 1:
    - create a gui app to produce calendar .ics file from a selected csv for household chores [ie, to import the chores as `room, task` from the list, attached file being an example format, but with reminders based on column `Frequency`being in column1];
allow to set time-of-day for reminder;
allow to set an overall period of repetition [ie, only the month, or a whole year];
have an option to add reminder\series-of-reminder to redo the import calendar, starting at a length of time specified in the gui before end-of-period [ie, a week before end-of-month-period, or a month before end-of-a-year-period]

 - prompt 2:
    - propose a readme, and speculate on a 'catchy' name for the app
